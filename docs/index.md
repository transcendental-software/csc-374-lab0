## Lab Assignment 0

Lab 0 is made out of two parts: Basics of Shell and Basics of C.
The two parts are crash courses that are meant to introduce you to the basic concepts and commands related to the Linux Shell and the basic concepts and instructions from the C programming language.
It is highly recommended to complete these two crash courses before working on any of the other labs.
